# WaveCart

WaveCart is a lean and user-friendly store extension for TYPO3 that has been specially developed for websites with just a few items. It offers all the basic e-commerce functions without the
functionality and complexity of larger store systems. Ideal for individual products, small collections or digital goods, WaveCart can be easily integrated into existing TYPO3 pages and flexibly
adapted.

The project is based on TYPO3 v13, using Composer.

## Installation

```sh
composer require typo3-incubator/wave-cart
```
Add the wave-cart siteset to the site configuration.
